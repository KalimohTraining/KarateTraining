This repo contains the files used in the youtube videos.

For a couple of videos have used projects from github and installed these locally, so if you are cloning the porject then you'll need to build these locally and then replace the IP and PORT in the feature files with the URL from your local project. Details for these are mentioned below

Video: Using scenario Outline
Repo Name: api-playground
URL:https://github.com/BestBuy/api-playground
Please follow the instructions in the project Readme.md on how to install locally

Video: Handling Authorization
Project used is available on github 
Repo name: nodejs-jwt-authentication-sample 
URL:https://github.com/auth0-blog/nodejs-jwt-authentication-sample


Thanks to "@satish testing" for asking question on few tests failing due to IP's in this project.
